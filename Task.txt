    My Course
1.I start SMTP server (http://192.168.104.11:1025)
2.I send email with sonya's photo From Client.
  Get Ok message from server.
3.Then If I don't know,save eml like person = unknown image = CAMNAME(sender)-YYMMDDHHMMSS.jpg
  in my case,
        sender = 'sender@example.com'
	recipient = 'recipient@example.com'
	file_location = 'Sonya.png'
  if I know him, print "I know him"

    My Answer
1.There are two men in my image_database(ru2.png,ru3.png),They are not Sonya.
2.In server, server get request and if I don't know,save that in images and save smtp request to emls   directory.
3.server don't know Sonya so a new file are made.Before start, I don't have any file.
  If I know him, only print "I know him"   
# I doubt that I understand rightly your requirement.
# Anyway,I solved problems as much as I understand.

The end.
